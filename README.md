# Composite-Pattern

The Composite Design Pattern lets you group objects into tree structures and work with these structures as if they were individual objects. This means you can treat a single object and a group of objects in the same way, allowing for more flexible and scalable code.

Key Points:
1. Uniformity: Allows clients to treat individual objects and composite objects (compositions of objects) uniformly.
2. Tree Structure: Represents part-whole hierarchies, where each node can be an individual object or a composition of objects.
3. Recursion: Operations on composite objects can be performed recursively.

Real-World Analogy:
Consider a file system on your computer. There are files and folders. Folders can contain multiple files or other folders. This structure can be represented as a tree:

1. File: An individual leaf node in the tree.
2. Folder: A composite node that can contain files and other folders.
Operations like calculating the total size of a folder, listing all items, or copying can be performed on both files and folders uniformly.
